Tire pressure monitoring system exercise in Java that Álvaro García [(@alvarobiz)](https://twitter.com/alvarobiz) and I [(@trikitrok)](https://twitter.com/trikitrok) paired to solve.

This is the first exercise of the [Refactoring legacy code driven by tests - Coding Dojo](https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises#readme) by [Luca Minudel](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/luKa/Default.aspx).

You can find [all the exercises in this Luca's GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples).

Thanks Luca!
